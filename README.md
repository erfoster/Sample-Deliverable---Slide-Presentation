# Sample-Deliverable---Slide-Presentation

## Assignment: Use R-markdown to create a slide deck that highlights skills with visualization. Include topical motivation, description of the data, and two or more slides of analysis.

### Research topic: 
This slide deck explores violence and peace in the Israel-Palestine conflict. It analyzes two topics: (1) fatalities of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza and (2) Palestinian economic sentiment and support for Israeli statehood.  

### Data:
Data for the first analysis comes from the [United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties). Data for the second analysis comes from the [Arab Barometer Datasets](https://www.arabbarometer.org/survey-data/data-downloads/). 

### Approach: 
Using summary statistics, a line graph, multiple bar graphs, and chi-squared testing this slide deck demonstrates Palestinian fatalities and evaluates the relationship between Palestinian economic sentiments and support for Israeli statehood.
